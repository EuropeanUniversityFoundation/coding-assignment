# Simple coding assignment for future developers of the European University Foundation

This repository contains a simple coding assignment for future developers of the 
European University Foundation. The tasks will require problem solving, as well 
as some development in PHP. 

This assignment is absolutely not a test as recruitment highly depends on the 
project specific profiles. The assignment is rather used to assess skills and 
estimate potential training required. 

To get started:

1. Fork the repository into your own GitHub account.
2. Clone the repository into your local development environment.
3. Loading the index.php will reveal the rest of the instructions.

> A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided for the use of docker. Alternatively the project can also be ran in a local LAMP environment.
